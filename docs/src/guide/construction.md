# Creating Networks

This guide covers all aspects of creating, modifying, and inspecting networks in Networks.jl.

## Network Constructors

### Basic Constructor

The primary way to create a network is with the `network` constructor:

```julia
using Networks

# Empty network (no vertices)
net = network()

# Network with n vertices and no edges
net = network(10)

```

With an explicit type parameter, qualify the type with the module name
(after `using Networks` in the REPL, the bare name `Network` refers to the
module, not the type):

<!-- skip-check -->
```julia
net = Network{Int64}(; n=10)
```

### R-Style Aliases

Networks.jl provides aliases that match R's `network` package API:

```julia
# R's network(10)
net = network(10)

# R's network.initialize(10); equivalent to network(10)
net = network_initialize(10)
```

### Constructor Options

All constructors accept keyword arguments controlling network properties:

```julia
net = network(10;
    directed = true,         # Edge directionality
    bipartite = nothing,     # Set to Int for two-mode networks
    loops = false,           # Whether self-loops are allowed
    multiple = false,        # Whether multi-edges are allowed
    hyper = false,           # Whether hyperedges are allowed
)
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `directed` | `Bool` | `true` | If true, edges have direction (source to target) |
| `bipartite` | `Union{Nothing,Int}` | `nothing` | Number of mode-1 vertices for bipartite networks |
| `loops` | `Bool` | `false` | Whether vertices can have edges to themselves |
| `multiple` | `Bool` | `false` | Whether parallel edges between the same pair are allowed |
| `hyper` | `Bool` | `false` | Whether edges can connect more than two vertices |

## Directed vs. Undirected Networks

The `directed` flag fundamentally affects how the network behaves:

### Directed Networks

In directed networks, each edge has a source (sender) and a target (receiver). Edge `(1, 2)` is distinct from edge `(2, 1)`:

```julia
net = network(3; directed=true)
add_edge!(net, 1, 2)

has_edge(net, 1, 2)  # true
has_edge(net, 2, 1)  # false  -- direction matters
ne(net)              # 1
```

Directed networks are used for asymmetric relationships like email communication, citations, advice seeking, or Twitter follows.

### Undirected Networks

In undirected networks, edges are symmetric. Adding edge `(1, 2)` automatically creates `(2, 1)`:

```julia
net = network(3; directed=false)
add_edge!(net, 1, 2)

has_edge(net, 1, 2)  # true
has_edge(net, 2, 1)  # true  -- both directions present
ne(net)              # 1     -- counted once, not twice
```

Undirected networks are used for symmetric relationships like friendship (in some contexts), co-authorship, physical proximity, or shared membership.

### Implementation Detail

Internally, Networks.jl always stores edges in a `SimpleDiGraph`. For undirected networks, both `(i, j)` and `(j, i)` are stored, but `ne()` divides by 2 and `edges()` only returns edges where `src <= dst` to avoid double-counting. Edge attributes use a canonical ordering via `minmax(i, j)` to ensure consistent lookups regardless of which direction you specify.

## Adding and Removing Vertices

### Adding Vertices

```julia
net = network(3)
nv(net)  # 3

# Add a single vertex
add_vertex!(net)
nv(net)  # 4

# Add multiple vertices
add_vertices!(net, 5)
nv(net)  # 9
```

New vertices are numbered sequentially starting after the current maximum vertex ID.

### Removing Vertices

```julia
net = network(5)
add_edge!(net, 1, 2)
add_edge!(net, 2, 3)

# Remove vertex 2 (also removes edges incident to vertex 2)
rem_vertex!(net, 2)
nv(net)  # 4
```

When a vertex is removed:

1. All edges incident to that vertex are removed
2. All attributes for that vertex are deleted
3. Edge attributes for removed edges are deleted
4. The last vertex is renumbered to fill the gap (Graphs.jl convention)

!!! note "Vertex Renumbering"
    When removing vertex `v`, vertex `nv(net)` is renumbered to `v` (the Graphs.jl swap-and-pop convention). Networks.jl remaps the renumbered vertex's attributes and its incident edge attributes automatically, so attribute data stays attached to the right vertices — but any vertex IDs you hold in your own variables still refer to the old numbering.

## Adding and Removing Edges

### Adding Single Edges

```julia
net = network(5)

# Add an edge (returns true if successful, false if already exists)
add_edge!(net, 1, 2)   # true
add_edge!(net, 1, 2)   # false -- edge already exists

# Add an edge with attributes
add_edge!(net, 2, 3, Dict(:weight => 1.5, :type => :friendship))
```

### Self-Loops

By default, self-loops are not allowed:

```julia
net = network(5; loops=false)
add_edge!(net, 1, 1)   # false -- self-loop rejected

net = network(5; loops=true)
add_edge!(net, 1, 1)   # true -- self-loop allowed
```

### Adding Multiple Edges

```julia
net = network(5)

# From a list of tuples
edges_to_add = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1)]
n_added = add_edges!(net, edges_to_add)  # returns 5
```

### Removing Edges

```julia
# Remove a single edge
rem_edge!(net, 1, 2)   # true if removed, false if not found

# For undirected networks, rem_edge! removes both directions
net = network(3; directed=false)
add_edge!(net, 1, 2)
rem_edge!(net, 1, 2)
has_edge(net, 2, 1)     # false -- both directions removed
```

When an edge is removed, all its attributes are also deleted.

## Bipartite Networks

Bipartite (two-mode) networks have two distinct vertex sets where edges only connect vertices from different sets.

### Creating Bipartite Networks

```julia
# 4 actors x 3 events
bnet = BipartiteNetwork(4, 3)

# Vertices 1-4 are mode 1 (actors)
# Vertices 5-7 are mode 2 (events)
bnet.n_mode1  # 4
bnet.n_mode2  # 3
nv(bnet)      # 7
```

### Adding Edges

Edges should connect vertices from different modes:

```julia
add_edge!(bnet, 1, 5)   # Actor 1 -- Event 5
add_edge!(bnet, 1, 6)   # Actor 1 -- Event 6
add_edge!(bnet, 2, 5)   # Actor 2 -- Event 5
add_edge!(bnet, 3, 7)   # Actor 3 -- Event 7
add_edge!(bnet, 4, 6)   # Actor 4 -- Event 6
add_edge!(bnet, 4, 7)   # Actor 4 -- Event 7
```

### Checking Bipartiteness

Two related but distinct notions are exposed:

- `Graphs.is_bipartite(net)` computes the **graph-theoretic** property:
  can the vertices be two-colored so that every edge joins the two color
  classes? (An edgeless graph is trivially bipartite.)
- `is_two_mode(net)` reports the **two-mode metadata flag**: was the
  network declared bipartite via `network(n; bipartite=k)` or built as a
  `BipartiteNetwork`?

```julia
using Graphs: is_bipartite

is_bipartite(bnet)  # true  -- only cross-mode edges are admitted
is_two_mode(bnet)   # true  -- carries mode metadata

# A one-mode network can still be bipartite as a graph...
net = network(4; directed=false)
add_edge!(net, 1, 2)
add_edge!(net, 2, 3)
is_bipartite(net)   # true  -- a path is two-colorable
is_two_mode(net)    # false -- no mode metadata

# ...and stops being bipartite once it contains an odd cycle
add_edge!(net, 1, 3)
is_bipartite(net)   # false

# Marking a Network as two-mode via the constructor sets the metadata flag
net = network(7; bipartite=4)  # 4 vertices in mode 1
is_two_mode(net)    # true
```

### BipartiteNetwork Properties

```julia
bnet = BipartiteNetwork(4, 3)
println(bnet)      # BipartiteNetwork{Int64}(4+3 vertices, 0 edges)
bnet.n_mode1       # 4
bnet.n_mode2       # 3
display(bnet)
# BipartiteNetwork{Int64}: directed two-mode network
#   Vertices: 7
#   Edges: 0
#   Directed: true
#   Loops: false
#   Two-mode: 4 mode-1 vertices (1:4), 3 mode-2 vertices (5:7)
```

## Network Properties

### Size and Density

```julia
net = network(10)
add_edges!(net, [(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (1,5)])

nv(net)                 # 10 -- number of vertices
ne(net)                 # 5  -- number of edges
network_size(net)       # 10 -- alias for nv()
network_edgecount(net)  # 5  -- alias for ne()
network_density(net)    # 0.0556 -- 5 / (10*9) for directed
```

### Density Calculation

`network_density` follows R's `network.density`: the edge count `m` over the
number of dyads that could carry a tie. The denominator depends on the
network type and on two keywords:

| Network Type | Formula | Maximum Edges |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| Directed, no loops | `m / (n * (n-1))` | `n * (n-1)` |
| Directed, with loops | `m / (n * n)` | `n^2` |
| Undirected, no loops | `m / (n * (n-1) / 2)` | `n * (n-1) / 2` |
| Undirected, with loops | `m / (n * (n+1) / 2)` | `n * (n+1) / 2` |
| Two-mode (`bipartite=n₁`), default | as the one-mode row above | all `n (n-1)` (or `/ 2`) dyads, within-mode ones included — R's `discount.bipartite=FALSE` |
| Two-mode, undirected, `discount_bipartite=true` | `m / (n₁ * n₂)` | `n₁ * n₂` cross-mode dyads |
| Two-mode, directed, `discount_bipartite=true` | `m / (2 * n₁ * n₂)` | `2 * n₁ * n₂` — one per direction |

- **`diag`** decides whether the diagonal (self-loops) is part of the dyad
  count. It defaults to the network's `loops` flag, exactly as R keys on
  `has.loops(x)`, so the "with loops" rows apply only to networks built with
  `loops=true`. `diag=false` on such a network mirrors `sna::gden(diag=FALSE)`:
  self-loops are dropped from both `m` and the denominator.
- **`discount_bipartite`** is a no-op on a one-mode network. The
  `BipartiteNetwork` wrapper and a `network(n; bipartite=n₁)` give the same
  answer for the same edge set.
- A network with **masked (unobserved) dyads is refused** by default; pass
  `missing=:face` to count edges at their stored face value (R's
  `na.omit=FALSE`). See [Missing Data](missing_data.md).

```julia
b = network(5; bipartite=2, directed=false)
add_edges!(b, [(1,3), (1,4), (2,5)])
network_density(b)                            # 0.3  -- 3 / 10, R's default
network_density(b; discount_bipartite=true)   # 0.5  -- 3 / (2*3)

l = network(3; loops=true)
add_edges!(l, [(1,1), (1,2)])
network_density(l)                            # 0.2222 -- 2 / 9
network_density(l; diag=false)                # 0.1667 -- 1 / 6, self-loop dropped
```

### Directedness

```julia
is_directed(net)    # true or false (a compile-time property of Network{T,D})
is_bipartite(net)   # graph-theoretic two-colorability
is_two_mode(net)    # two-mode metadata flag
```

### Vertex and Edge Iteration

```julia
# Iterate vertices
for v in vertices(net)
    println("Vertex: ", v)
end

# Iterate edges (src/dst are Graphs.jl accessors)
using Graphs: src, dst
for e in edges(net)
    println(src(e), " → ", dst(e))
end

# Existence checks
has_vertex(net, 3)    # true if vertex 3 exists
has_edge(net, 1, 2)   # true if edge (1,2) exists
```

## Neighborhoods and Subgraphs

### Neighborhoods

Find all vertices within a given distance of a focal vertex:

```julia
net = network(6; directed=false)
add_edges!(net, [(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6)])

# Direct neighbors of vertex 1 (order=1, default)
nbhood1 = get_neighborhood(net, 1)
# Set{Int64} with 2 elements: {1, 2}

# 2-neighborhood (distance <= 2)
nbhood2 = get_neighborhood(net, 1, 2)
# Set{Int64} with 3 elements: {1, 2, 3}

# 3-neighborhood
nbhood3 = get_neighborhood(net, 1, 3)
# Set{Int64} with 4 elements: {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

The returned set always includes the focal vertex itself.

### Induced Subgraphs

Extract a subnetwork containing only specified vertices and edges between them:

```julia
net = network(6)
add_edges!(net, [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6)])
set_vertex_attribute!(net, :name,
    Dict(1=>"A", 2=>"B", 3=>"C", 4=>"D", 5=>"E", 6=>"F"))
set_edge_attribute!(net, :weight,
    Dict((1,2)=>1.0, (1,3)=>2.0, (2,3)=>1.5, (3,4)=>3.0, (4,5)=>2.0, (5,6)=>1.0))

# Extract subgraph with vertices {1, 2, 3}
sub = get_induced_subgraph(net, [1, 2, 3])
nv(sub)  # 3
ne(sub)  # 3 (edges 1→2, 1→3, 2→3)

# Vertex and edge attributes are preserved (with remapped IDs)
get_vertex_attribute(sub, :name)  # Dict(1=>"A", 2=>"B", 3=>"C")
```

Note that vertex IDs are remapped to `1:length(vlist)` in the subgraph. Attributes are carried over with the new IDs.

## Vertex Permutation

Reorder vertex IDs according to a permutation:

```julia
net = network(4)
add_edges!(net, [(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)])
set_vertex_attribute!(net, :name, Dict(1=>"A", 2=>"B", 3=>"C", 4=>"D"))

# Reverse the vertex order
perm = [4, 3, 2, 1]
net_perm = permute_vertices(net, perm)

# Vertex 1 in the new network was vertex 4 in the old
get_vertex_attribute(net_perm, :name, 1)  # "D"
get_vertex_attribute(net_perm, :name, 4)  # "A"
```

The permutation vector `perm` specifies which old vertex occupies each new position: `perm[new_id] = old_id`.

## Display

A network has two displays, as R's `network` has `print` and its one-line
summary. At the REPL (or under `display`) it prints the block R users expect
from `print.network` — including `Directed:`, `Loops:` and, for a two-mode
network, the mode sizes, the three things most often mistaken — with
attribute names sorted:

```julia
net = network(5)
add_edges!(net, [(1,2), (2,3)])
set_vertex_attribute!(net, :name, Dict(1=>"Alice", 2=>"Bob"))
set_edge_attribute!(net, :weight, Dict((1,2) => 1.5))
set_network_attribute!(net, :title, "Test")

display(net)
# Network{Int64}: directed network
#   Vertices: 5
#   Edges: 2
#   Directed: true
#   Loops: false
#   Vertex attributes: name
#   Edge attributes: weight
#   Network attributes: title
```

Inside a container — a `Vector` of panel waves, a `Dict`, the `NamedTuple`
that `load_dataset(:s50)` returns — and from `println`/`string`, it is one
line, so a panel of three networks reads as three lines rather than a wall:

```julia
println(net)                       # Network{Int64,true}(5 vertices, 2 edges)
println(network(3; loops=true))    # Network{Int64,true}(3 vertices, 0 edges, loops)
println(network(6; bipartite=2))   # Network{Int64,true}(6 vertices, 0 edges, two-mode 2+4)
s50 = load_dataset(:s50)
s50.friendship                     # 3-element Vector{Network{Int64, true}}: one line per wave
```

## Creating Networks from External Data

Networks can also be created from matrices, edge lists, DataFrames, and files. See:

- [Conversion](conversion.md) for `network_from_matrix`, `network_from_edgelist`, and `network_from_dataframe`
- [I/O](io.md) for `read_pajek` and other file formats

## Random Graph Generation

For random graph generation, use the companion [SNA.jl](https://github.com/statistical-network-analysis-with-Julia/SNA.jl) package which provides `rgraph`, `rgnm`, and `rgnp` functions:

```julia
using SNA

# Erdos-Renyi G(n,p) random graph
net = rgnp(100, 0.05)

# G(n,m) random graph with exactly m edges
net = rgnm(100, 200)
```

Or use Graphs.jl's random graph generators and convert:

```julia
using Graphs

g = erdos_renyi(100, 0.05)
# Use g directly -- Networks.jl is compatible via AbstractGraph
```
