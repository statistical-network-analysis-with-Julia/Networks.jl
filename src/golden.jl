# Golden-fixture harness: frozen R output, with provenance.
#
# Issue #8 across the ecosystem ("Estimator validation is uneven"): several
# packages carry `# golden value from R` comments with no record of WHICH R,
# which package version, which seed, or what tolerance was thought acceptable.
# A bare number in a comment cannot be regenerated, cannot be audited, and
# silently rots when the reference implementation changes. For long-lived
# academic software that is not evidence — it is folklore.
#
# So a fixture here is a FILE, not a number, and it must carry:
#
#   [provenance]  the R version, the exact package versions, the seed, the
#                 script that produced it, and the date. Enough to regenerate.
#   [tolerance]   what agreement was deemed acceptable, and WHY — Monte-Carlo
#                 estimators cannot be compared to machine precision, and the
#                 tolerance is a scientific claim that belongs under review.
#   [values]      the frozen output itself.
#
# The R script that generates a fixture lives beside it (`r/<name>.R`), in the
# repository, so the whole chain is reproducible by anyone with R.
#
# TOML is stdlib (read-only parse), so this adds no dependency to Networks.jl.

    GoldenFixture

Frozen output from a reference implementation (R statnet / RSiena / relevent),
with the provenance needed to regenerate and audit it.

# Fields
- `name` — the fixture's identifier
- `values::Dict{String,Any}` — the frozen numbers (coefficients, SEs, targets…)
- `tolerance::Dict{String,Any}` — the agreed tolerances, per value or global
- `provenance::Dict{String,Any}` — R version, package versions, seed, script, date
- `script_path::String` — the absolute path of the generating script named by
  `provenance["script"]`, resolved on disk by [`load_golden`](@ref) (a fixture
  whose script cannot be found does not load)

Load with [`load_golden`](@ref); compare with [`check_golden`](@ref). The
struct has no external constructor: a `GoldenFixture` only ever comes from a
provenanced file on disk.

# Example
```julia
g = load_golden(joinpath(pkgdir(Networks), "test", "fixtures", "network_density.toml"))
g isa GoldenFixture             # true
g.provenance["network_version"] # the R `network` version the values came from
isfile(g.script_path)           # true — the generating R script, resolved on disk
```

"""
    load_golden(path::AbstractString; root=nothing) -> GoldenFixture

Load a golden fixture from a TOML file and **refuse to load one that cannot be
audited**. A fixture missing its `[provenance]` block — the R version, the
package versions, the seed, and the generating script — throws, because an
unprovenanced golden value is not a check on anything: it cannot be regenerated
when the reference implementation changes, and a future maintainer cannot tell
whether a mismatch means their code broke or R moved.

The named `provenance.script` must also **exist**. It is resolved by walking up
the ancestors of the fixture's directory — the directory itself, its parent,
and so on to the filesystem root — until `joinpath(dir, script)` is a file, so
the conventional `script = "test/fixtures/r/<name>.R"` (relative to the
package root) resolves from any working directory, and an ad-hoc fixture can
keep its script beside it as `r/<name>.R`. Pass `root=` to start the walk from
a different directory (a fixture copied out of its package, say). An absolute
`script` is used as given. Relative paths are normalized to the platform's
path separators. The resolved absolute path is stored in the
returned fixture's `script_path` field and printed by `show` and
[`golden_report`](@ref). A fixture whose script cannot be found throws an
`ArgumentError` naming the fixture, the script string and every directory
searched, for the same reason an unprovenanced one does.

# Example
```julia
using Networks

g = load_golden(joinpath(pkgdir(Networks), "test", "fixtures", "florentine_sna.toml"))
g.provenance["sna_version"]      # "2.8"
g.values["density"]              # the frozen sna::gden value
isfile(g.script_path)            # true — test/fixtures/r/harness_selftest.R

    golden_tolerance(g::GoldenFixture, key::AbstractString) -> Float64

The tolerance agreed for `key`, falling back to the fixture's `default` and then
to `0.0`. Comparing a Monte-Carlo estimator to a reference at machine precision
is meaningless, so the tolerance is stated in the fixture rather than invented at
the call site — which makes it reviewable.

# Example
```julia
g = load_golden(joinpath(pkgdir(Networks), "test", "fixtures", "network_density.toml"))

Returns a `Bool` so it drops straight into `@test`. Use
[`golden_report`](@ref) to see *why* a comparison failed.
