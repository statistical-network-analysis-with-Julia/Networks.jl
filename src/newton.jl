# Shared Newton–Raphson optimizer and logistic-likelihood derivatives.

# Every likelihood-based fitter in the ecosystem — ERGM's MPLE, the
# pseudo-likelihoods of ERGMMulti/TERGM/ERGMRank/ERGMCount, REM's conditional
# logit and Relevent's ordinal and interval models — maximises a smooth concave
# objective by Newton–Raphson with step halving, and most of them over the
# SAME logistic log-likelihood. Three packages carried the same optimizer and
# four the same logistic loop (review 2026-07 finding 15; panel 2026-09, item
# 14). Both live here now, in the one foundation every model package already
# depends on (REM.jl and Relevent.jl deliberately do not depend on ERGM.jl,
# which is also why `bootstrap_cov` is here).
#
# Only stdlib LinearAlgebra is used (`cholesky`, `Symmetric`, `mul!`, `norm`):
# Networks.jl stays dependency-light.
#
# The names are `public`, not exported (see the `public` block in Networks.jl):
# ERGM.jl re-exports them as `import Networks: newton_fit, logistic_derivatives`
# + `export`, so `using ERGM` keeps working unchanged while there is exactly ONE

    newton_fit(loglik_grad_hess, θ0::AbstractVector;
               maxiter=100, tol=1e-8, max_halvings=10) -> NamedTuple

Maximize a smooth objective (typically a log-likelihood) by Newton–Raphson
with step halving.

`loglik_grad_hess(θ)` must return a tuple `(ll, grad, hess)`: the objective
value, its gradient vector, and its Hessian matrix at `θ` (the Hessian of the
objective itself, i.e. negative-definite near a maximum). Each Newton step
`−hess \\ grad` is halved up to `max_halvings` times until the objective is
finite and does not decrease (a decrease within a few ulps of `|ll|` counts as
"does not decrease" when the gradient norm shrinks with it: rounding noise at
the optimum is not a descent). Convergence is declared when the **Newton
decrement** `½ ∇ℓᵀ(−H)⁻¹∇ℓ` — the objective gain the full Newton step could
still deliver, scale-free in the parameters and in the same units as `tol` —
is below `tol` (the full step is then taken, as the polish that lands on the
maximum), or when the objective change is below `tol` and the gradient norm
below `sqrt(tol)`.

This is the ONE Newton optimizer of the ecosystem, hosted in Networks.jl so
that packages which do not depend on ERGM.jl (REM.jl, Relevent.jl) share it
too; ERGM.jl re-exports it. Pair it with [`logistic_derivatives`](@ref) for
any logistic (pseudo-)likelihood.

# Arguments
- `loglik_grad_hess`: Function `θ -> (ll, grad, hess)`
- `θ0::AbstractVector`: Starting values (copied, not mutated). The objective
  must be finite there (`ArgumentError` otherwise).

# Keywords
- `maxiter::Int=100`: Maximum Newton iterations
- `tol::Float64=1e-8`: Convergence tolerance on the objective change
- `max_halvings::Int=10`: Maximum step halvings per iteration

# Returns
NamedTuple `(θ, se, vcov, loglik, converged, iterations)`:
- `vcov` is `inv(-hess)` at the final iterate, computed through a Cholesky
  factorization of diagonally equilibrated `-hess` — the usual observed-information covariance when
  the objective is a log-likelihood — and `se = sqrt.(diag(vcov))`.
- **If `-hess` is not positive definite** at the solution (a saddle, a flat
  direction, a non-identified coefficient), the covariance is *undefined*:
  `se` and `vcov` are filled with `NaN`, `converged` is false, and a warning is emitted.
  Numerical identification requires the smallest eigenvalue of the information
  scaled to unit diagonal to exceed `p * eps(Float64)` times its largest.
  This criterion is invariant to changes of individual coefficient units;
  it detects singular information that roundoff can let Cholesky accept. The old
  `sqrt.(abs.(diag(pinv(-hess))))` would have returned finite, meaningless
  numbers here.
- `converged == false` when `maxiter` is exhausted, when the Newton step
  cannot be formed (singular Hessian), or when no step halving finds a
  finite, non-decreasing objective. Only a failed factorisation of the
  Hessian is treated as "no Newton direction"; any other error raised while
  forming the step — a gradient of the wrong length (`DimensionMismatch`), a
  Hessian that is not a matrix (`MethodError`), an interrupt — is a bug in
  `loglik_grad_hess` and propagates instead of being reported as
  non-convergence. **A step at which the objective is not
  finite (`NaN`, `±Inf`) is never taken**: it is halved like a decrease, and
  if every halving is non-finite the iteration stops at the last finite
  iterate. When the halvings only find finite *decreasing* objectives, `θ`
  is left where it is and `converged` reports whether the gradient is
  already below `sqrt(tol)`. Before any halving, an iterate whose Newton
  decrement is below `tol` takes the full step — provided it is finite and
  loses no more than `max(tol, 8·eps(|ll|))`, which the quadratic model
  bounds — and is converged there: this is the polish R's `glm` reports as
  converged at the same point, and it is what makes the verdict
  scale-free.

The decrement criterion (panel 2026-09, TERGM/ERGMRank/REM round-2
findings) is what makes the verdict independent of the scale of the design:
on a pseudo-likelihood over thousands of rows with a statistic running to
~30 the gradient's own units put `sqrt(tol)` below the rounding floor of the
objective, so Newton stalled one ulp short of the maximum with
`‖∇ℓ‖ ≈ 1e-4` and reported a converged fit as unconverged — and BLAS
rounding then decided which bootstrap replicates counted as converged.

Callers should surface `converged == false` to the user (an unconverged fit
is a loud result in this ecosystem, never a silent one).

# Poisson mean via the log-likelihood of k events: ll(θ) = kθ − exp(θ)
import Networks: newton_fit    # public, not exported
k = 7.0
fit = newton_fit(θ -> (k*θ[1] - exp(θ[1]), [k - exp(θ[1])], hcat(-exp(θ[1]))),
                 [0.0])
fit.θ[1] ≈ log(k)         # true
fit.se[1] ≈ 1 / sqrt(k)   # true: observed information is k at the MLE
fit.converged             # true

    logistic_derivatives(X, n_tot::AbstractVector{<:Real},
                         n_one::AbstractVector{<:Real}; offset=nothing) -> Function

The `(ll, grad, hess)` closure of a logistic log-likelihood on design matrix
`X` (`n × p`), ready for [`newton_fit`](@ref).

**Binary rows** (`y`, optionally with non-negative `weights`, e.g. the
multiplicity of a collapsed dyad class):

    ℓ(β) = Σ_r w_r [ y_r η_r − log(1 + e^{η_r}) ],   η = Xβ + offset
    ∇ℓ   = X' w (y − p),   ∇²ℓ = −X' diag(w p(1−p)) X.

**Binomial rows** (`n_tot` trials of which `n_one` are successes, so that a
row stands for a whole class of identical dyads — the form ERGM's MPLE uses
after collapsing dyads with identical change statistics):

    ℓ(β) = Σ_r [ n_one,r η_r − n_tot,r log(1 + e^{η_r}) ]
    ∇ℓ   = X'(n_one − n_tot ⊙ p),   ∇²ℓ = −X' diag(n_tot ⊙ p(1−p)) X.

Both forms run through ONE kernel: the binary form is the binomial one with
`n_tot = weights` (or 1) and `n_one = n_tot ⋅ y`, so a weighted binary fit
and the equivalent duplicated-row fit give identical `ll`, `grad` and `hess`
to rounding. `log(1 + e^η)` is evaluated on its numerically stable branch on
both sides of zero.

Every ERGM-family pseudo-likelihood over dyad-independent rows is this
likelihood — `ERGM.mple`'s logistic regression on the change statistics,
`ERGMMulti`'s MPLE over the within-layer dyads, `TERGM`'s CMPLE over the free
dyads of the auxiliary networks, `ERGMRank`'s swap MPLE over the (ego,
alter-pair) comparisons (with `y ≡ true`: the observed order is always the
"success") — so it lives here, next to `newton_fit`, rather than pasted into
four packages. `offset` (a fixed per-row addition to the linear predictor) is
`ergm`'s offset mechanism: `ERGMMulti` uses it for terms whose coefficients
are held fixed.

**Allocation** (review finding 15): the workspaces are allocated ONCE, when
the closure is built. Each evaluation allocates only the length-`p` gradient
and `p×p` Hessian it returns — never the `n×p` weighted design or a per-row
`x * x'` outer product. The "Shared Newton optimizer" testset pins this with
`@allocated`, and the downstream packages mirror it.

Throws `ArgumentError` on a length mismatch, a negative or non-finite weight,
or a binomial row with `n_one` outside `[0, n_tot]`.
