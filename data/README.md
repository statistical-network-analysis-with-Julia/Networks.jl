# Bundled teaching datasets

Tab-separated files loaded by `load_dataset(name::Symbol)` (see
`src/datasets.jl`). Every value was extracted programmatically from the
upstream R objects and cross-checked against this ecosystem's own golden
fixtures (SNA.jl, ERGM.jl, ERGMEgo.jl, Siena.jl). The Florentine and Sampson
files were parsed from the statnet `ergm` package's `data/florentine.RData`
and `data/sampson.RData` (https://github.com/statnet/ergm); the three
datasets added in 2026-09 (panel item 22) are produced by the checked-in
script `r/extract_datasets.R`, which needs only base R (>= 4.5) and the
CRAN `network` package:

```bash
Rscript data/r/extract_datasets.R      # from the package root; downloads the two R objects
```

The script prints the SHA-256 of every upstream file it consumed and of every
TSV it wrote; the hashes below are from the run that produced the committed
files (R 4.6.1, network 1.20.0, 2026-09-09), so a regeneration can be checked
against them.

## Florentine families (Padgett)

- `florentine_vertices.tsv` — 16 families with `name`, `wealth` (net wealth
  in thousands of lira, 1427), `priorates` (seats on the civic council,
  1282–1344), `totalties` (total number of business or marriage ties in the
  full Padgett dataset of 116 families).
- `florentine_marriage_edges.tsv` — 20 undirected marriage ties
  (statnet `flomarriage`).
- `florentine_business_edges.tsv` — 15 undirected business ties
  (statnet `flobusiness`).

Sociology* 98(6), 1259–1319. Distributed with statnet's `ergm` package
(GPL-3); the underlying data are historical facts collected by Padgett and
are in wide public use.

## Sampson monastery (liking)

- `sampson_vertices.tsv` — 18 monks with `name`, `group`
  (Loyal / Outcasts / Turks, the three-way faction assignment used by
  statnet's `samplike`), `cloisterville` (attended the minor seminary of
  "Cloisterville" before entering the monastery).
- `sampson_edges.tsv` — 88 directed "liking" ties: i → j if monk i named
  monk j among his top-three liked monks at *any* of the three time points
  (statnet's aggregated `samplike` network). `nominations` counts the number
  of time points (1–3) at which the tie was named.

## faux.mesa.high (statnet `ergm`)

- `faux_mesa_high_vertices.tsv` — 205 students: `id`, `Grade` (integer,
  7–12), `Race` (`Black`, `Hisp`, `NatAm`, `Other`, `White`), `Sex` (`F`,
  `M`). Attribute names are statnet's, capitalised, so `nodematch("Grade")`
  reads the same in both languages.
- `faux_mesa_high_edges.tsv` — 203 undirected friendship ties (`source`,
  `target`, smaller id first, sorted). 163 join students of the same grade —
  the `nodematch.Grade` target that the provenanced
  `ERGMEgo.jl/test/fixtures/fauxmesa_ego_census.toml` pins to `[203, 163]`.

## WTC police radio calls (Butts, Petrescu-Prahova & Cross 2007)

- `wtc_police_calls_events.tsv` — 481 radio calls among the 37 named
  communicants of a police unit at the World Trade Center on the morning of
  2001-09-11: `number` (1…481, the observed order — the data are *ordinal*,
  there is no clock), `source`, `recipient` (actor ids 1–37; no self-calls;
  35 of the 37 actors ever call or are called).
- `wtc_police_calls_actors.tsv` — the 37 actors: `id`, `is_icr` (1 for the
  three actors, 13, 14 and 32, who occupied *institutionalised coordinator
  roles*; R's `WTCPoliceIsICR`).

Source: the CRAN `relevent` package (1.2-1) ships **no** data directory; the
objects `WTCPoliceCalls` and `WTCPoliceIsICR` are distributed with statnet's
relevent workshop, downloaded from

## s50 (RSiena; Teenage Friends and Lifestyle Study)

Files under `s50/`, all header-less integer matrices with one row per actor:

- `friendship_wave1.tsv`, `friendship_wave2.tsv`, `friendship_wave3.tsv` —
  50 × 50 directed adjacency matrices (RSiena `s501`, `s502`, `s503`),
  entry (i, j) = 1 if girl i named girl j as a friend; 113, 116 and 122
  ties respectively, no self-ties.
- `alcohol.tsv` — 50 × 3 (RSiena `s50a`), alcohol use per wave coded
  1 = none, 2 = once or twice a year, 3 = once a month, 4 = once a week,
  5 = more than once a week.
- `smoke.tsv` — 50 × 3 (RSiena `s50s`), smoking per wave coded 1 = none,
  2 = occasional, 3 = regular (more than once a week).

The 50 girls are an excerpt of the 160-pupil Glasgow cohort of the Teenage
Friends and Lifestyle Study, observed at three yearly waves from 1995 (age
13). Source: the `s50` objects bundled with RSiena (GPL-2+). The committed
files were converted from the comma-separated copies Siena.jl carried under
`test/data/` — the same matrices from which the provenanced
`Siena.jl/test/fixtures/s50_siena07.toml` was generated with **RSiena
1.6.6** (its script `test/fixtures/r/s50_siena07.R` reads `s501`… from
RSiena directly). Input hashes (`s501.csv`, `s502.csv`, `s503.csv`,
`s50a.csv`, `s50s.csv`):

When RSiena is installed the extraction script reads the objects from it
instead (and the hashes of the written files must come out identical).
